# jpapi

An OpenAPI with CORS enabled with full MongoDB query language ([$match (aggregation)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/)), see also the [schema](https://github.com/patarapolw/jpapi/blob/master/packages/server/src/db/mongo.ts)).

My intention is, it will always be free.

See <https://jpapi.polv.cc>

## Self-hosting

I made this a Docker. You can always pull from Docker Hub and host it yourself.

```sh
docker pull patarapolw/jpapi
```

The dumped database can be found [here].

## Chinese API

There is also a version for Chinese, <http://zhres.herokuapp.com/api/doc>
